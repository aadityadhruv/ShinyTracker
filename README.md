# ShinyTracker



An app to detect and track shiny Pokemon on the Nintendo DS for Pokemon Games. 



The DS screen is detected, and the live frames are extracted and processed in order to detect whether the current instance is overworld or in-battle, to increment the shiny counter accordingly. 


Currently developing the classification model to be more sophisticated than k-means.
